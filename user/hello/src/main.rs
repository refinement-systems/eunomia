//! The real `hello` — the first *non-fixture* user program on std. Where
//! `user/stdsmoke` is a gate fixture, this is the actual
//! "hello world" a user runs from the shell (`run bin/hello`), and its whole point
//! is that a real program now boots on the std runtime with no bare-metal
//! scaffolding of its own.
//!
//! It is a real std program — no `#![no_std]`, no `#![no_main]`, no
//! `#[panic_handler]`. std owns `_start` (the eunomia PAL, rev2§5.1), the
//! allocator, and the panic handler. `extern crate eunomia_sys;` is the one
//! non-obvious line: it forces the seam rlib into the link so the linker resolves
//! the PAL's undefined `__eunomia_*` `extern "Rust"` symbols against eunomia-sys's
//! `#[no_mangle]` definitions (the `__rust_alloc` pattern).
//!
//! Arms (validating entry/argv/alloc/exit/STATUS_PANIC):
//!   - argv via `env::args`, allocation via `Vec`/`String`/`format!`,
//!   - the inherited environment via `env::var` (init→shell→child),
//!   - a monotonic `Instant` delta,
//!   - a clean `exit(0)` (returning from `main`), and
//!   - `run bin/hello panic` → std's own handler terminates as STATUS_PANIC so the
//!     parent shell reaps `panicked`, not `exited(_)`.

extern crate eunomia_sys; // links the PAL↔seam bridge (see module doc)
